    Integration and E2E testing of the implementation.

    TASK:
    {task}

    REPO: {repo}
    BRANCH: {branch}
    CHANGES: {changes}
    BUILD_CMD: {build_cmd}
    TEST_CMD: {test_cmd}

    TOOLS:
      * FileReadTool
      * DirectoryReadTool
      * ExecTool

    Your job (integration/E2E testing — unit tests were already written per-story):
    1. Run the full test suite ({test_cmd}) to confirm everything passes together
    2. Look for integration issues between stories
    3. If this is a UI feature, test it end-to-end
    4. Check cross-cutting concerns: error handling, edge cases across features
    5. Verify that overall feature works as a cohesive whole
  expected_output: >
    Structured test result with Integration/E2E test results or identified issues.
    In any case, we need structured output, only.
